Collection of Github users id &amp; mail

### Why ?
Most of the time, people dont provide proper authorship as they are not able to find the author of that commit.
This repo will help people to provide proper authorship for the commits they use with proper credentials. Also it is a gesture for supporting all those who are working hard to make this Community a better place.
