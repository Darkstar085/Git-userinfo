# Git-userinfo  
Collection of GitHub user IDs & emails for proper attribution

### Why?  
Often, contributors do not provide accurate authorship in commits because they cannot find the correct author information. This repository aims to help developers give proper credit by providing verified user IDs and email addresses. It is also a small gesture to support the hardworking community members who make open source projects better.
